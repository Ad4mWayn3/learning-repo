Yesterday I was, like, reaaaally thirsty, and there was nothing but macadamia, so I thougt, why not make some macadamia juice?

The thing with macadamia is, why is it so goddamn expensive!? I'd drink it forever if I could afford it!!

## Who actually came up with the name "macadamia"?

Macadamia is for sure a fancy word (tho not as fancy as palm) , I quite like it.

## "Palm" should also get some attention

And I think it's way cooler.
